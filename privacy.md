# FlashFocus Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** May 5, 2025

FlashFocus (“we”, “us”, “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Deck Content  
- Questions, answers, images, and audio in any deck you create or save.

### 1.2 Usage Metrics  
- Session durations, correct/incorrect counts, deck review schedules, feature interactions.

### 1.3 Device & Technical Data  
- Device model, operating system version, app version, locale, unique device identifiers.

### 1.4 Crash Reports & Analytics

- Aggregated, privacy-focused metrics via **Plausible Analytics**.

### 1.5 Optional Personal Info  
- **Email address** if you choose to:

  - contact us for support or privacy inquiries.  
- **Note:** You do **not** need an account or to share any personal information to use FlashFocus’s core study features.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

- **Provide & Improve the App:** Enable core features, diagnose bugs, and optimize performance.  
- **Personalization:** Power spaced-repetition schedules and remember your study preferences.  
- **Communications:** Send reminders, updates, and respond to support or privacy requests (only if you’ve provided an email).  
- **Analytics:** Understand usage patterns to make data-driven improvements.

---

## 3. Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as your account exists or as necessary to provide our services. When you delete your account (see Section 4), we securely erase or anonymize your personal data within 30 days.

---

## 4. Account Deletion

You can permanently delete your account—and all associated decks and data—**directly in the app**:

> **Settings → Delete my account**

After confirming, your data will be irreversibly removed from our servers within 30 days.  
If you encounter any issues, email **info@minervaeduapp.com** for help.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

- **Firebase Crashlytics** (Google) for anonymous crash reporting.  
- **Plausible Analytics** for GDPR- and CCPA-friendly usage statistics.

We do **not** sell or share personal data with advertisers or other third parties.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

FlashFocus is designed for **users of all ages**:

- **No account** is required—anyone, including children under 13, can study without registering.  
- We do **not** knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.  
- To create an account, you must provide a valid email address and verify with a code sent to that email. Completing that verification serves as our only mechanism to confirm consent—if the user is under 13, it indicates a parent or guardian has authorized the use of their information. Should we learn that a child under 13 has provided personal data without proper consent, we will delete it immediately upon request. 
- Parents or guardians may request deletion of a minor’s data at any time (see Section 4 or email **info@minervaeduapp.com**).

---

## 7. International Data Transfers

Your information may be processed and stored on servers located worldwide. By using FlashFocus, you consent to transfers of your data across borders.

---

## 8. Security

We implement industry-standard technical and organizational measures to protect your data. However, no internet transmission or storage system can be guaranteed 100% secure.

---

## 9. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

- **Access:** Request a copy of your personal data.  
- **Correction:** Ask us to update or correct inaccurate data.  
- **Deletion:** Permanently erase your data (via the in-app “Delete my account” button or by emailing **info@minervaeduapp.com**).  
- **Restriction/Objection:** Limit or object to certain processing activities.  
- **Withdraw Consent:** Opt out of email communications at any time.

To exercise these rights, use the in-app deletion flow or email **info@minervaeduapp.com**.

---

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will post the updated policy here and revise the **Effective date**. Your continued use of FlashFocus after changes implies your acceptance.
