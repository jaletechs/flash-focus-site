# Learn Faster, Remember Longer

FlashFocus is your pocket-sized study partnerâ€”whether you jump into expertly curated decks or build your own with text, images & audio.  
With AI-powered spaced repetition, custom reminders, and real-time progress tracking, youâ€™ll master any subject faster and keep it in your long-term memory.

## How It Works

1. **Personalize Your Path**  
   On first launch, choose your main goalâ€”_Learn_, _Prepare for an exam_, _Have fun_, or _Other_. Then pick the times you like to study (morning coffee â˜•, commute ðŸš‡, lunch break ðŸ¥ª, group sessions ðŸ‘¥, and more).

2. **Discover & Save Decks**  
   Browse **Featured Decks** or search the Store for topics you loveâ€”history, languages, sports trivia, law, you name it. Tap **Save** on any deck to add it to **My decks**.

3. **Study with Smart Cards**  
   Flip cards, listen to audio, and watch your progress bar fill up as you go. Our clean, distraction-free UI keeps you focused on one card at a time.

4. **Spaced Repetition & Reminders**  
   FlashFocus automatically schedules reviews so you see cards just when youâ€™re about to forget them. Get push reminders at your preferred study moments.

5. **Build & Share Your Own**  
   Create custom decksâ€”add text, images, or audioâ€”then share with friends via link or import from CSV/JSON.

6. **Track Your Mastery**  
   View session stats, success rates, and time-of-day trends to fine-tune your learning strategy.
